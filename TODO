* Can the input to the logspace Cook-Levin reduction be a nondeterministic
  polynomial time Turing machine?
* What is the length of the input to the logspace Cook-Levin reduction?
* What is the length of the output from the logspace Cook-Levin reduction?
* Find a reference which explicitly states that the Cook-Levin reduction is
  computable in logarithmic space.
* Complete the "enhanced" part of this proof.
* Why do we have r < 2^{k + 1} (k - 2) instead of something like r < 1 + 1 /
  (2^{k + 1} (k - 2) - 1)?
* What does it mean for an optimization problem to be both complete for APX
  under polynomial time reductions and complete for NCX under polynomial
  time reductions?
* Find a reference which states the collapse due to APX = PTAS.
* Note that the key component which implies both P not in PTAS and P is
  APX-complete is the gap-introducing reduction.
* Find an NC approximation for MAX 3SAT.
* Why can we assume without loss of generality that each formula f_s(C(B(x,
  i))) has the same number of clauses?
* Note that the function which outputs $y$ given $\phi_i$ and $\tau_i$ can be
  computed in logarithmic space.
